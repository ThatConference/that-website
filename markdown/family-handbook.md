Hi, and welcome to the awesome that makes up THAT Conference! This Family Handbook should have the answers you need to successfully navigate
the rapids leading up to, and right on through, the big event in August. Even if you've been to THAT Conference before, things may have
changed. This Family Handbook is your best source for up-to-the-minute information on what to do and where to go. Please check back periodically
for updates as well, as we'll be answering Frequently Asked Questions as they come up.

If for some reason, this guide does not answer a question you may have, here are a couple resources that you can use to get you out
of the woods:

### Purchasing Tickets

We are, after all, a Big Tent conference, and we want you to know that your families are not only welcomed, but encouraged to join us for
Geekling sessions. Each family member requires their own ticket to THAT Conference; tickets can be purchased through the same link as the main conference tickets.

We realize we're doing something special and new here by including our families in the event, and that always results in a little confusion.  
Here is how we think about the family ticket: If a child (regardless of age) and/or adult companion wants to join us at the pig roast or
attend/be present for any of the family sessions, then they will need a ticket and be accompanied by an adult. The family ticket is our way
of including our families in with the love of technology, while still covering costs of food, space, swag, Counselors, etc. Even if they don't
have a family ticket, they are still invited to the water park party, and if you're staying with the Kalahari, they can play around on the
water slides all day long.

### Registration

When you get into town stop down at the registration desk. It’s located down in the main drag of the conference center and you won’t miss it.
Early registration and our Meet and Greet start at 6pm on Monday. This year we’ll see over 1000 campers of all ages show up at our campsite.
We’re expecting that our queuing theory algorithms probably aren't completely optimized, so there might be a line. But this is a line of your
peeps, your fellow campers, and folks you'll be around for the next three days. Decorate your badges and get to know your fellow campers.

### Schedule

Given the different ages of your young campers and the variety of age targets for various sessions, it can be difficult to plan
your camping adventure. Start at the Full Session Lineup (coming April 2020) to start planning your
sessions for your Geekling campers. All of the sessions have a target age range to allow you to plan for the optimal sessions for the younger geeks among us!

### Mess Hall

What would a Summer Camp be without some great outdoor cooking, done indoors? Wednesday night is our famous Pig Roast, where our attendees can get together and feast with their ticketed family members and really bring everyone together for a wonderful celebration of community.

While the family ticket does not include conference meals beyond the Pig Roast, we've
partnered with many Kalahari Restaurants to offer discounts to our families. THAT Conference Families receive a 10% discount at the following restaurants within the Kalahari. You must show your THAT Conference badge to receive the discount, and the offer is not valid with other coupons or for alcohol.

- Great Karoo Marketplace Buffet
- Ivory Coast Restaurant
- Wisconsin Brew Pub
- Safari Snacks
- Zulu Grill
- Zanzibar

**NOTE:** The 10% discount does not apply to Double Cut, Java Manjaro or the Indoor Theme Park.
