### Tickets are now on sale!

This August we're setting up a new kind of camp. This year's THAT Conference puts you in the driver's seat. You set the topics. You set the schedule. You pick the price. You're in control all from the comfort of your own camp chair. We're calling it THAT Online.

### Our theme this year: Inspire & Connect

<br>
### New Camp, New Format, New Possibilities

Our mission is simple: to connect people. We want to help each and everyone of you level up. While it's impossible to replicate our time together in August online, THAT Online brings us all a whole new set of opportunities. We're not bound by physical space and time; that means we can further fulfill our 365 day mission.

This year we’re taking our two favorite parts of THAT Conference and are bringing them to you online: Keynote(s) and Open Spaces. Right now we're expanding our platform to best facilitate Open Spaces but online.

### How do I participate?

You will need a ticket to enter camp. This year we’ve restructured our tickets and you get to pick the price.
