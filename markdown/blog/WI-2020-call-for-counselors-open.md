### OMG, All THAT Excitement, Tell Me More! ü§©

THAT is a multi-day, community-driven, family friendly, polyglot tech conference with session offerings for all ages and experience levels. We take over the Kalahari in Wisconsin Dells for 4 straight days. Kicking off with a full day of hands on workshops, followed with 3 days of 1 hour sessions, open spaces, social events, hands-on activities for our campers, campmates and of course our geeklings of all ages and levels.

#### Submission Process

THAT is built and organized by the community for the community. This year we have built a NEW submission process to better accommodate our community needs and help us continue to grow.

From now until March 1st we accept session submissions. The submissions are then opened up, anonymously, to the community for voting until March 22. Finally THAT Crew begins the difficult final selection process to get the schedule announced April 17th.

#### Counselor Benefits

If selected to speak, you will receive a ticket to attend all 4 days of THAT Conference; meals during the event, including the THAT Pig Roast; 2 night stay at the Kalahari per accepted talk (3 nights max per family); opportunity for professional recording of your session (does not apply to geekling/family track sessions); and countless networking opportunities.

#### Topics

Now the list of potential topics is endless. If we were to break topics down into categories, here's how we think about things:

- **Technical:**¬†How To, Why To
- **Experiential:**¬†Sharing Experiences.
- **Mind and Body / Soft Skills:**¬†Be a better you.
- **Workshop / Hands-On:**¬†Banging on Keyboard
- **Family¬†Focused:**¬†Teaching our Youth

If you'd like to see a technical talk, it has an audience...submit it! We embrace the diversity of ideas across our entire community and industry. Want to come out and talk about AI? Feel strongly about improving developer health? Want to talk about testing strategies for client-side web languages? Those are all fantastic ideas! Color outside the lines and be creative, we love that!

#### Can Geeklings under 13 submit abstracts?

YES! We love having Geeklings present, and many have given epic level sessions. Here is what you do: if a child under age of 13 wishes to submit a talk proposal, a parent will have to submit under their own account. Please note in the session submission form that you are submitting on behalf of a child where it asks for any information important for us to know.

#### Ready For All THAT Help?

Do you...

- **Need some help formalizing your idea?**
- **Would you like someone to review your session and provide feedback?**
- **Just curious if it's a subject people will find valuable?**
- **Need a bit of mentoring and support?**

Simply put, we're here to help. Not just the folks at THAT Conference but the entire community who represents THAT.
