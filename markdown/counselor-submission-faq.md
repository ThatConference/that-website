We've collected a number of questions that we feel may (or have already been) frequently asked surrounding the process of submitting a session to speak at THAT Conference. If your question isn't answered here feel free to reach out in Slack in the #sessions channel or via e-mail at [hello@THATConference.com](mailto:hello@THATConference).

### Why do I need a new account?

After THAT Conference 2019, we deleted our old site and created a new one from the ground up. Everything went with it, including user accounts. You have to create a new account on the site.

### What happened to my old sessions?

After THAT Conference 2019, we deleted our old site and created a new one from the ground up. Everything went with it, including sessions. We are currently working to build out the rest of the site functionality, including migrating over past sessions and Counselors. [Sign up for our newsletter](#newsletter), [join THAT Slack](https://thatslack.thatconference.com/) and/or watch our social media as we announce new site functionality as we release it.

### My child is under 13 years of age, what should I do?

We don't support accounts for users under the age of 13 to be in compliance with State and Federal laws around child safety online. If your child would like to speak at THAT Conference, please submit the session under your own account. There is a field on the session form that lets you tell us anything else that's important for us to know - tell us there that you're submitting on behalf of your child. If the session is accepted, we'll work with you to get their information for the site.

### Is there a limit to number of sessions I can submit?

Nope. This year we took away the cap and want to hear all of the awesome topics you are passionate about speaking on. Workshops, sessions, family... get creative and submit it! We can't wait to read all your awesome ideas.

### Can I get help with developing my session submission?

Sure! Firstly, we suggest you [join THAT Slack](https://thatslack.thatconference.com/) and check out the #sessions channel. Conference staff and other previous counselors are there and ready to help. If you'd rather email us, you can reach us at [Hello@THATConference.com](mailto:Hello@THATConference). The worst thing you can do is not ask! Let us help you be your most awesome.
