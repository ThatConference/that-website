<a href="#section-before" name="section-before">### Before the Conference</a>

#### Counselors

<a href="#q2" name="q2" class="faq-link">**Q: How do I become a Counselor (Speaker)?**</a>

**A:** For more information, please see our <a href="https://www.thatconference.com/wi/call-for-counselors" target="_blank">Call for Counselors</a> page. We welcome anyone regardless of background, skill level, or age to submit a talk proposal. We have both a professional and family track, where we encourage kids to teach other kids!

<a href="#q3" name="q3" class="faq-link">**Q: Will I be paid to be a Counselor?**</a>

**A:** We do not pay any fees to our Counselors. Those selected as a Counselor will receive a full, 4 day ticket, 2 night hotel room (3 night max per family, base rate) stay at the Kalahari, all conference provided meals, and of course, some awesome swag!

<a href="#q4" name="q4" class="faq-link">**Q: Will THAT Conference pay my travel expenses if I am selected to be a Counselor?**</a>

**A:** No. We are conference run by a small team of dedicated volunteers. We do not have the financial ability to pay travel expenses for our Counselors outside of the 2 night room compensation (3 nights max per family, base rate).

#### Tickets & Food

<a href="#q5" name="q5" class="faq-link">**Q: Help! My plans changed and I can't attend THAT Conference anymore! Can I get a refund on my ticket? Or transfer to someone else?**</a>

**A:** That's a bummer you can't attend anymore. If you can find someone to take your paid ticket, it can be transferred using the link in your ticket receipt email.
If you encounter any issues doing this, email us at hello@thatconference.com.
If you absolutely cannot find anyone to transfer your ticket to, all cancellations will need to be initiated with an email to hello@thatconference.com. Refunds will not be issued for requests received after July 4th, 2020. Please note that a processing fee will be applied per ticket refund as follows: $30 processing fee for all Professional tickets (4 day, 3 day, 3 day- no food), $10 processing fee for Pre-Conference, Family, and Pig Roast Only tickets.

<a href="#q6" name="q6" class="faq-link">**Q: Can I grab a soda or coffee if I don't have a food ticket?**</a>

**A:** Unfortunately, no. The beverages are tied to the food ticket. There is ice water provided throughout the conference area for all to enjoy.

<a href="#q7" name="q7" class="faq-link">**Q: I have a food ticket. Can my family eat with me?**</a>

**A:** Food from the buffet lines is limited to those with a food ticket. We ask that if your family wishes to join you for breakfast or lunch, they meet you in the seating area with self-provided meals. This ensures that we have an accurate head count for accounting purposes.

<a href="#q8" name="q8" class="faq-link">**Q: What is the wristband I received at registration for?**</a>

**A:** If you received a wristband, it is because you have a food ticket. This wristband, along with your name badge, allows you full access to the breakfast, lunch, and social gathering food offerings; included are beverages in the buffet areas. Geeklings and Campmates should have received a Pig Roast Only wristband that will allow access to the Pig Roast on Wednesday night.

<a href="#q9" name="q9" class="faq-link">**Q: Do I need to wear the food wristband the whole time?**</a>

**A:** Yes. These work much like the waterpark wristbands, except you need the food band to access the food buffets and not the wave pool. As this band is not transferable between individuals, we will place it on you during the registration process and we ask that you wear it the length of the conference to ensure that you are able to access the full benefits of your ticket. The Pig Roast Only wristband is the responsibility of the individual to place before arriving to that event.

<a href="#q10" name="q10" class="faq-link">**Q: I have a no food ticket but would like to attend the Pig Roast. Can I purchase a ticket to that only?**</a>

**A:** Yes. A Pig Roast Only ticket is \$50 per child or adult. One may be purchased <a href="https://www.thatconference.com/wi/tickets" target="_blank">on our Ticket page</a>

<a href="#q11" name="q11" class="faq-link">**Q: I have dietary restrictions. Will I be able to eat at the conference provided meals?**</a>

**A:** Yes! We've worked with the Kalahari to accommodate as many dietary restrictions as we can. There will be a special buffet line you may choose food from. Of course, you may also visit the main buffet to select food from there as well. Should you find yourself in need of assistance, please find a THAT Crew member. We'd be happy to assist!

<a href="#q13" name="q13" class="faq-link">**Q: I ordered the wrong shirt size? Can I exchange it?**</a>

**A:** Yes. We have a quiet, dedicated room for our Counselors. You may stop in anytime if you need to practice or just need a quiet place to gather your thoughts. We do not mark this on any conference map as it is reserved for Counselors only. More can be found in our <a href="https://www.thatconference.com/wi/counselor-handbook" target="_blank">Camp Counselor Handbook</a>. We'll do our best to remind you of this room at registration.

**A:** Absolutely! We encourage you to not only attend sessions, but become part of our community. Before arriving, we recommend becoming part of <a href="https://thatslack.thatconference.com/" target="_blank">THAT Slack</a>. We have a welcoming community that keeps the conversation going year round. During the conference, conversations can be found all over. Some of the best ones happen in the hallways between sessions. That's why we have 30 minutes between each session! You can also head over to Open Spaces for small group discussions on a variety of topics. After hour events are also planned for the night time hours specifically to encourage socialization and community building.
