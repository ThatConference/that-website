        Submit a topic to become a counselor or edit existing sessions. Let the
        creative juices flow here. We all like to read a good abstract and this
        might be the first thing a camper knows about you. Not sure which topic
        to present? Submit more than one! In fact, submit as many as 3. Weâ€™ll
        pick the coolest ones on April 17th.
