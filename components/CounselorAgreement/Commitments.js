          You agree to the Code of Conduct and a zero tolerance policy for any
          sort of harassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Youâ€™ll promise to meet new people and really discover what it means to
          be a part of THAT Conference.
        </li>
        <li>
          You recognize that the job of being a counselor doesn't just end when
          your session is over. Being available for questions after and
          attending other sessions are examples of how you can be a bigger part
          of THAT Conference.
